            <li>Juice from 1/2 lemon</li>
            <li>1 tbps fresh parsley - chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*Seasoning dependeds on personal taste. You can add more at the end to give it more flavor.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot heat oil over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add onion, saute until translucent</li>
            <li>Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes </li>
            <li>Add chopped carrots and celery. Put the lid on the pot and let vegetables steam about 8 minutes, or until they start to soften. Stir often</li>
            <li>Once the carrots and celery have softened a bit (Check carrrots with a fork. The prongs should stab through somewhat easily), add the chicken stock, sprigs of fresh thyme, dried thyme, oregano, black pepper, and salt</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and add in your prefered pasta (you can use the traditional Egg Noodles or any other type of pasta. I like using elbows). Let pasta cook for the time instructed on the package</li>
            <li>When pasta is cooked, turn off burner and add shredded chicken, lemon juice, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Stir until chicken is heated through. Add any additional seasoning needed to taste, then serve and enjoy!</li>
